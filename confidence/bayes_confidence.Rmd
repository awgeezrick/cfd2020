In the [problem for the education minister](../chapters/08/where_and_argmin) for this trick of using `np.where` to find the
index.

We get the proportion at that index, to give the probability that we will see a
sample mean between 54.5 and 55:

```{python}
p_around_54p5 = proportions[bin_54p5]
p_around_54p5
```
