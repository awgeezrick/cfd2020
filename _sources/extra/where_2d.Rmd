# Where and argmin in 2D

This follows from [where and argmin](../mean-meaning/where_and_argmin).

That page covers how `np.where` and `np.argmin` work for one-dimensional
arrays.

This page covers what happens for arrays of two dimensions and more.

## Revision: the one-dimensional case

```{python}
import numpy as np
```

```{python}
arr = np.array([2, 99, -1, 4, 99])
arr
```

```{python}
indices = np.where(arr == 99)
indices
```

We can use the returned `indices` to index into the array, using square brackets.

```{python}
arr[indices]
```

## The two-dimensional case

This also works in two or more dimensions.  Here is a two-dimensional array,
with some values of 99.

```{python}
arr2d = np.array([[4, 99, 3], [8, 8, 99]])
arr2d
```

`np.where` now returns two index arrays, one for the rows, and one for the columns.

```{python}
indices2d = np.where(arr2d == 99)
indices2d
```

Just as for the one-dimensional case, we can use the returned indices to index into the array, and get the elements.

```{python}
arr2d[indices2d]
```
