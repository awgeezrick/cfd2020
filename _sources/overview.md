## Description

This course is an introduction to coding for data analysis.

Coding is a fundamental skill for modern research.  Learning to code gives you
enormous power and flexibility for data analysis.  It will also give you tools
for deeper understanding of data analysis and statistics.

## What we aim to teach

*   Data analysis through coding - "data science".
*   Simple programming with Python and standard Python libraries.
*   Loading data.
*   Selecting and exploring data.
*   Plotting data.
*   Simulation and basic statistical inference.
*   Straight line relationships with correlation and regression.

## Course textbook

We will be following the online class textbook at
<https://github.com/matthew-brett/cfd2020>.

We will also be referring to material from the [Berkeley 2018 EdX course on
data
science](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:BerkeleyX+Data8.1x+1T2018/course).
You will need to make a free account at EdX to reach the material.

## Policies

See policies on [working together](Working together).  Please make sure you
read and understand that page; it covers collaboration (very good!) and
straight copying of work (very bad!).

For assessment see [Assessment and Feedback](Assessment and Feedback).
