## Correlation ##

In this section we will develop a measure of how tightly clustered
a scatter diagram is about a straight line. Formally, this is called
measuring *linear association*.


The table `hybrid` contains data on hybrid passenger cars sold in the
United States from 1997 to 2013. The data were adapted from the online
data archive of [Prof. Larry Winner](http://www.stat.ufl.edu/%7Ewinner/)
of the University of Florida. The columns:

- `vehicle`: model of the car
- `year`: year of manufacture
- `msrp`: manufacturer's suggested retail price in 2013 dollars
- `acceleration`: acceleration rate in km per hour per second
- `mpg`: fuel economy in miles per gallon
- `class`: the model's class.

You can download the file via [hybrid.csv](../data/sat2014.csv).

```{python}
sat2014 = pd.read_csv('sat2014.csv').sort_values('State')
sat2014.head()
```

The scatter diagram of Math scores versus Critical Reading scores is
very tightly clustered around a straight line; the correlation is close
to 0.985.

```{python}
sat2014.plot.scatter('Critical Reading', 'Math')
```

```{python}
correlation(sat2014, 'Critical Reading', 'Math')
```

That's an extremely high correlation. But it's important to note that
this does not reflect the strength of the relation between the Math and
Critical Reading scores of *students*.

The data consist of average scores in each state. But states don't take
tests â€“ students do. The data in the table have been created by lumping
all the students in each state into a single point at the average values
of the two variables in that state. But not all students in the state
will be at that point, as students vary in their performance. If you
plot a point for each student instead of just one for each state, there
will be a cloud of points around each point in the figure above. The
overall picture will be more fuzzy. The correlation between the Math and
Critical Reading scores of the students will be *lower* than the value
calculated based on state averages.

Correlations based on aggregates and averages are called *ecological
correlations* and are frequently reported. As we have just seen, they
must be interpreted with care.


### Serious or tongue-in-cheek?

In 2012,
a [paper](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/courses/bio621/misc/Chocolate%20consumption%20cognitive%20function%20and%20nobel%20laurates%20%28NEJM%29.pdf)
in the respected New England Journal of Medicine examined the relation
between chocolate consumption and Nobel Prizes in a group of countries.
The [Scientific
American](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/the-curious-wavefunction/chocolate-consumption-and-nobel-prizes-a-bizarre-juxtaposition-if-there-ever-was-one/)
responded seriously whereas
[others](http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/10/us-eat-chocolate-win-the-nobel-prize-idUSBRE8991MS20121010#vFdfFkbPVlilSjsB.97)
were more relaxed. You are welcome to make your own decision! The
following graph, provided in the paper, should motivate you to go and
take a look.
