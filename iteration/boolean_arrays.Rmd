# Boolean arrays

```{python}
# Import the array library
import numpy as np
```

In the next section [reply to the Supreme Court](reply_supreme), we will give
an answer to the question we posed earlier.

The question was about Robert Swain's jury selection.  As you remember, Robert
Swain was a young black man sentenced to death in a trial in which all 12
members of his jury were white.

Of the eligible jurors in Talladega County, Alabama, 26% were black.  But even
if jury selection is entirely random, we will get some variation in the number
of black jurors.  The question is - is 0 a surprising number?

In order to answer that question, we are going to simulate a jury of 12 people,
in a world we imagine, and build with computer code.

We want to simulate a juror who has a 26% of being black.   We can do this by
drawing a random integer that has an equal chance of being any integer between
0 and 99 inclusive, like this:

```{python}
# Make a random integer from 0 through 99
# (from 0 up to but not including 100)
r_num = np.random.randint(0, 100)
r_num
```

Run this cell above a few times to persuade yourself this generates integers
from 0 through 99.

We will say `r_num` means a black juror if the integer is any number from 0
through 25, and a white juror otherwise.  Because there are 26 integers from 0
through 25, and 74 integers from 26 though 99, this means that there is a 26%
chance that running the cell above will give us an `r_num` that means a black
juror, and a 74% chance it will mean a white juror.

```{python}
# Make 12 random integers from 0 through 99
randoms = np.random.randint(0, 100, size=12)
```
